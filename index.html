            <p>Celisse is an aspiring web developer located in Orlando, FL. Celisse's passion for technology began at a very young age, when she started building websites and personal blogs using basic HTML and CSS in the early days of the internet. She is, as it turns out, very old. In any case, after working for 15 years in customer service and technology retail sales, she decided to persue her interests in creative web development, which brought her to UCF's Coding Bootcamp.<br><br>
            When she's not coding, you can find Celisse hanging out at Disney World, on a cruise, or playing with her tiny MaltiPoo, Maui.</p>
